# Prove that `recall` makes no network calls.

# The privacy boundary for sensitive repositories is that prompts and
# transcripts never reach a new external service. This script does not assert
# that; it measures it. It runs `recall ingest` (graph disabled, so only the
# recall binary itself is under test) and `recall activate` under strace with
# the network syscall family traced across every child process, and fails if
# a single socket, connect, send or receive is recorded.
#
# Usage:  recall/scripts/verify-offline.sh [path-to-recall-binary]
# Needs:  strace. Exits 2 when it is missing rather than claiming success.
